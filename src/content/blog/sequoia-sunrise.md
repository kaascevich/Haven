description: The new best semi-default wallpaper?
---

This is one of a few new wallpapers added in macOS Sequoia, and serves as a semi-default of sorts:

![The first frame of an absolutely beautiful wallpaper.](../../assets/images/sequoia-sunrise.png)

I flippin' _adore_ this wallpaper. Like, Sequoia Sunrise is to me what [Bliss] was to everyone who existed at the time -- it's just _perfect_.

This says something, considering that usually I'm the kind of person who avoids (semi-)default wallpapers like ~~COVID-19~~ the plague.

If this wallpaper evokes that feeling in you, too, then you're in luck. Here's how you can get the wallpaper on your device.

## Macs running macOS Sequoia

1. Open System Settings &rarr; Wallpaper.
2. The wallpaper should be right at the top of the Landscape section (alongside a bunch of other beauties). Click it to start downloading it -- it's a bit shy of 500 megs, so be patient.
3. Once it's downloaded, it should apply automatically.
4. If you want, you can also set it as your screensaver so that you get to stare at a beautiful forest for even longer. To do this, simply turn on "Show as screen saver".

Once it's on your device, you can also find the raw `.mov` file at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd/Customer/4KSDR240FPS`.

## Other devices (PC, iPhone, etc.)

You can save the hero image above directly to your device -- it's in full 4K resolution (albeit as a `webp`, which you may have to [convert] first). If you want it as a video, [Mr. Macintosh] has it hosted on Google Drive [here][wallpaper].

description: TWO major hurricanes? Really?
---

Hurricane Milton was a tropical storm yesterday morning. 24 hours later, it ballooned into a Category 3 hurricane. Now, [it's a Cat 5](https://apple.news/Abf4DVCgVQSeZPuzDsDeRXQ). All the models roughly agree on its path -- straight up the I-4 corridor.

We live on the east coast of Florida, so when Helene wandered along the west coast a week and a half ago, we were rather lucky -- we got away with a day of heavy rain and a single tornado warning that didn't end up amounting to anything. But it seems these hurricanes are remarkably determined to cause as much chaos in this godforsaken state as possible, because not only are we about to get hit by another hurricane, it'll be _a direct hit_.[^1]

Stay safe, folks. This state is an absolute disaster right now.

[^1]: Or at least as direct a hit as you can get when hitting it from the wrong direction, but it's still pretty direct.

description: It's useless, and I love it
---

2 summers ago, I bought an iMac G4 on eBay for around $150.[^1]

<!-- TODO: insert image here -->

The iMac came with a keyboard, though no mouse. Both were (and are) quite yellowed, but aside from the Num Lock light not working, both computer and keyboard were (and are) fully functional. Even the original 40-gig hard drive is still kicking along just fine.

It originally had a copy of Mac OS X[^2] 10.3 Panther installed. I wanted to replace that with a dual-boot setup -- Mac OS 9 + Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. I did get there, but it involved a hella lotta wasted CDs, very slow download speeds[^3], and the complete and utter destruction of a perfectly good Panther install.

[^1]: Why? I dunno. I guess I just really wanted a really old, really useless iMac.
[^2]: I can't possibly be the only one who actually pronounces that as "mac oh-ess _ex_"... "mac oh-ess _ten_ ten point three panther" just sounds fundamentally wrong.
[^3]: Yes, I connected this thing to the internet. This was 2 years ago, I was na√Øve back then. Don't judge me.
